# This file contains data about Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript

Javascript contains classes based on an explaination

```Javascript 

# The OOP is a Programming Paradigm

## OBJECT

- Collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase


## WHY

To resolve spaghetti and messed up code

## Parts of OOP

Object Litereal 

- Constructor Function
- Prototypes 
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)




4 Keywords to remember (Important)


# 4 Pillars
Abstraction = to hide detail = fetch hides the internal detail to show less data
Encapsulation = it wraps and covers the data and function can be used to hide data from certain people or access
Inheritance = It takes down or shares data from parent or children function and data
Polymorphism = many ways and methods to perform tasks


# NEW KEYWORD created
The new kwyword initiates the creation of a new Javascript Object.

# PROTOTYPE is linked
The newly created object gets linked to the prototype property of the contructor function. This means that it has access tp properties and methods defined on the constructors prototype.

# UNDERSTANDING PROTOTYPE EXAMPLE ON LINE: 48 in Object.js

# CONSTRUCTOR is called 
This Function is called with the specified arguments and this is bound to the newly created objects. If no explicit return value is specified from the constructor. Javascript assumes this, the  newly created object, to be the intended return value.

# The NEW Object is returned: 

After the constructor function has been called, if it doesnt return a non-primitive value (object, array, function, etc.), the newly created object
